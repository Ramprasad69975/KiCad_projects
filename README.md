# 🚀 KiCad PCB Design Playground

Hello everyone! 👋  
Welcome to my KiCad PCB design repository — this is where I turn circuit ideas into real PCB layouts.

This repository is a collection of my **PCB design projects, experiments, and learning journey** using KiCad. You’ll find schematics, board layouts, and Gerber files as I explore both analog and digital circuit design.
